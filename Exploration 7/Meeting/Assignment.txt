HARDER
1) Set up a random image generator and a random text generator. (Make sure each image has a corresponding text)
2) On ONE button click, both image and text should randomly generate. 
    - If the text and image are matching, show an image below the generators as a check mark
    - If the text are not, give an alert to the user, and show the image below as a wrong answer
    
EASIER
1) Setup a random generator but this will be only in the backend, so there will be no text displaying the randomly generated number
2) Setup an input and button for the user where they can guess the number. 
3) When clicked the button:
    - Check if the input is completely empty and if so, alert the user
    - Check if the input is a number
    - Check if the input matches the randomly generated number
        - If yes, then give them an alert saying "YOU WON!"
        - If no, give them an alert saying "You lost by: {number - guess}"
4) Reset Button
    - Generate a new random number
    - Clear the input
